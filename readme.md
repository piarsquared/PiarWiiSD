## About

**PiarWiiSD** is a [currently Windows-focused](#Compatibility) Python application designed to simplify the management of homebrew files and other content for your Wii console. It automates the process of organizing files onto your SD card, ensuring everything is in the correct directory for seamless use with the Homebrew Channel and other tools.

**Key Features**

* **Intuitive Interface:** PiarWiiSD provides a straightforward graphical user interface that guides you through the process.
* **Automated File Organization:** Automatically sorts common homebrew files like `.dol`, `.wad`, and game saves into their correct folders (e.g., `apps`, `wads`, `saves`).
* **Error Prevention:** Minimizes the risk of file misplacement, which can cause homebrew applications to fail.

## How to Use

## Compatibility

PiarWiiSD is compatible with all Wii models (RVL-001, RVL-101, even the 3 people using a modded Wii mini, but probably do that yourself) and is designed to work with SD cards formatted to FAT32.

PiarWiiSD is currently only intended to be run on Windows as of now. I am looking into porting to Linux/MacOS, but I would need to learn about SD card detection on those respective platforms.

# Important:

**Be sure that your SD card is formatted to FAT32 before installation. Note that this will delete ALL files currently on the SD card. That is why I will not provide tools to format your SD card.**
